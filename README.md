# DevX MCP Server - Rootstock Blockchain Tools

**Rootstock MCP Server** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides advanced tools for interacting with the Rootstock (RSK) blockchain. This project enables AI clients to seamlessly connect and execute blockchain operations.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 💼 **Wallet Management**: Create, import, switch and manage multiple wallets
- 💰 **Balance Queries**: Check rBTC and ERC20 token balances
- 💸 **Transfers**: Send rBTC and tokens to other addresses
- 🔍 **Transaction Tracking**: Verify transaction status by hash
- 🚀 **Contract Deployment**: Deploy smart contracts on Rootstock
- ✅ **Contract Verification**: Verify deployed contracts
- 📄 **Contract Interaction**: Read data from verified contracts
- 🌉 **RSK Bridge**: Interact with the Rootstock bridge
- 📊 **History**: Query transaction history
- 📦 **Batch Transfers**: Execute multiple transfers

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18 or higher
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **TypeScript** (included in dev dependencies)

> **Note:** You will use this Model Context Protocol Server from a LLM Client (e.g Cursor, Claude, Warp, etc) which needs to be compatible with the MCP standard. Take into account there are 2 steps here:
> 1. Installation and Build
> 2. AI Client Configuration

IMPORTANT: You need to complete both settings to correctly use MCP within the Client.


## 🛠️ Installation and Build

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rsksmart/rsk-mcp-server
cd rsk-mcp-server
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Build the Project

```bash
npm run build
```

This command:
- Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript in the `build/` folder
- Makes the main file executable (`build/index.js`)

### 4. Verify Installation

```bash
node build/index.js
```

> **Important Note:** For local running this MCP, your client will point to the `index.js` file created on the `build` folder after building it.

## ⚙️ AI Client Configuration

### 🏠 Local Configuration

### For Cursor IDE

In Cursor, go to Settings > Cursor Settings > Tools & Integrations 

You will see an option to `Add Custom MCP`
<img src="./doc/img/cursorSettings.png" alt="MCP View" style="width:100%; height: auto;" />

And add to the JSON file:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rsk-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/your/project/rsk-mcp-server/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
// The Args field contains the path to the index.js file created by the build.
```
> **Note:** For install reference on Cursor, please follow these instructions [Here](https://docs.cursor.com/en/context/mcp)

Once it is installed into Cursor, you should see something like:
<img src="./doc/img/cursorInstalled.png" alt="MCP View" style="width:100%; height: auto;" />

Green dot indicates it was installed correctly.

### For Claude Desktop (Anthropic)

Edit your Claude Desktop configuration file:

Open your Claude client, and then click on Settings/Developer 

<img src="./doc/img/claudeSettings.png" alt="Claude settings" style="width:100%; height: auto;" />

Click the “Edit Config” button to open the configuration file and add the following configuration:

> **Note:**  This action creates a new configuration file if one doesn’t exist, or opens your existing configuration. The file is located at:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rsk-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/your/project/rsk-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
// The Args field contains the path to the index.js file created by the build.
```
> **Note:** For install reference on Claude, please follow these instructions [Here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)

Once you have installed this MCP on the Claude client, you will see it once you click on the `Search and tools`option under Web search option (see next image)

<img src="./doc/img/claudeApp.png" alt="MCP View" style="width:100%; height: auto;" />

### For Other MCP Implementations

Any MCP-compatible client can connect using:

```bash
node /path/to/project/DevXMcp/build/index.js
```

### 🌐 Remote Configuration (URL)

> **Note:** This functionality will be available when the server is deployed to a public endpoint.

#### Remote Client Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rsk-mcp": {
      "url": "https://your-server.com/mcp-endpoint",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
## 🔧 Detailed Functionality

Once this MCP is installed on the client, you will be able to interact with it by prompt, using chat box, for example, a good prompt to start interacting with this MCP is to write a prompt like:
`I would like to start interacting with Rootstock`

Then it will require you to give permission to use the MCP tool, you click on accept, and then it should answer something like:

```
Perfect! The Rootstock CLI is now active and ready to help you interact with the Rootstock blockchain. Here are the available options:
Available Rootstock Operations:
💼 wallet - Manage your wallet (create new, use existing, or import)
💰 balance - Check wallet balances
💸 transfer - Transfer RBTC or ERC20 tokens
🔍 tx - Check transaction status
🚀 deploy - Deploy a smart contract
✅ verify - Verify a contract
📄 contract - Interact with a contract
🌉 bridge - Interact with RSK bridge
📊 history - Check transaction history
📦 batch-transfer - Execute batch transactions
❓ help - Display help
What would you like to do? If you don't have a wallet yet, I'd recommend starting with option 1 (wallet management) to create or import a wallet first. Then you can proceed with other operations like checking balances, transferring tokens, or deploying contracts.
Which option interests you?
```

You can continue the flow according to what you need to do.

## 🔐 Security

### Private Key Management
- Private keys are stored encrypted using AES-256
- Each wallet has its own unique IV (initialization vector)
- Passwords are never stored in plain text

### Best Practices
- Use strong and unique passwords
- Maintain secure backups of `my-wallets.json`
- Do not share configuration files
- Use testnet for testing

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Module not found"
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### MCP Connection Error
- Verify absolute path in configuration
- Ensure the project is compiled
- Check MCP client logs

### Wallet Issues
- Verify `my-wallets.json` format
- Check password in `password.json` (in case you managed the password in a file)
- Ensure sufficient funds for transactions
